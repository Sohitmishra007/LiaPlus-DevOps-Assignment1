Task: Set up monitoring/logging using Prometheus & Grafana or ELK Stack.

Short Explanation: I set up Prometheus to monitor app performance, used Grafana for visualization, and created alerts for critical issues. This helped ensure the appâ€™s performance was constantly monitored and issues were quickly identified.

Deliverables: Steps for configuration, dashboard screenshots, and alert setup.
