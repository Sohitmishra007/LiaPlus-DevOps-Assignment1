 Disaster Recovery & High Availability

I defined a cloud-native disaster recovery strategy:

RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 30 mins

RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 5 mins

Backups were automated using Azure Backup Vault for VMs. Snapshots were scheduled daily, and failover was tested by restoring to a new VM.
