Task: Write a Bash/Python script for server setup or log analysis.

Short Explanation: I wrote a Python script that automates the installation of server packages (e.g., Nginx) and starts services like Nginx. This saves time in manual setup.

Deliverables: Script file and explanation of its functionality.
