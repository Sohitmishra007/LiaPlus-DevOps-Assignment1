Task: Write a Bash/Python script for server setup or log analysis.

Short Explanation: I wrote a Python script that automates the installation of server packages (e.g., Nginx) and starts services like Nginx. This saves time in manual setup.

Deliverables: Script file and explanation of its functionality.
--------------------------------------




 Automation & Scripting

I created a Python script to automate server provisioning. It installs Nginx, configures a static website, and restarts the service. The script reduces manual provisioning and ensures consistency.

Script: Written in Python using subprocess and os modules.

Use Case: Helps set up web servers quickly for demo or staging environments.
