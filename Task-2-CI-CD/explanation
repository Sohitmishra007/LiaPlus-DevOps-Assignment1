Task: Automate the deployment of the web app using GitHub Actions/Jenkins/GitLab CI.

Short Explanation: I created a CI/CD pipeline that automates build, test, and deployment stages. The pipeline ensures that after each push to the main branch, the app is built, tested, and deployed to Azure.

Deliverables: CI/CD YAML/Jenkinsfile, explanation of pipeline stages, and environment variables management.

CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

I created a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is triggered on push events to the main branch. It contains three stages:

Build: Installs dependencies.

Test: Runs application tests.

Deploy: Deploys to Azure VM using SSH.

Environment secrets like VM_IP, SSH_USER, and PRIVATE_KEY were securely stored using GitHub Secrets. This ensures sensitive data is not exposed



--------------------------
--------------------------
Pipeline Stages:

Build: Code is checked out, dependencies are installed, and the application is built.

Test: Automated tests are run to ensure code quality.

Deploy: The application is deployed to Azure App Service or VM using Azureâ€™s Web Apps Deploy GitHub Action.

Environment Variables/Secrets Management:

Secrets like Azure Web App publish profile can be stored in GitHub Actions Secrets.
