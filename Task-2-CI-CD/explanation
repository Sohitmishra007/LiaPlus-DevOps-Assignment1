Task: Automate the deployment of the web app using GitHub Actions/Jenkins/GitLab CI.

Short Explanation: I created a CI/CD pipeline that automates build, test, and deployment stages. The pipeline ensures that after each push to the main branch, the app is built, tested, and deployed to Azure.

Deliverables: CI/CD YAML/Jenkinsfile, explanation of pipeline stages, and environment variables management.
