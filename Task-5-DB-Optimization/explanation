Task: Optimize PostgreSQL or MongoDB database for performance.

Short Explanation: I implemented indexing, query optimization, and data partitioning to improve the performance of database queries. This reduced response times and enhanced overall database efficiency.

Deliverables: Explanation of techniques, example queries before and after optimization.

Database & Storage Optimization

For PostgreSQL:

Indexing: Added indexes on commonly queried fields.

Query Optimization: Used EXPLAIN ANALYZE to find slow queries and rewrote them.

Partitioning: Split large tables by date for faster access.

Before and after optimization, query time dropped by ~40%.
